    <h3>AKA: Tdawg (by my bishop)</h3>
    <p>I am planning on being a software engineer and I really like computers.
         I'm really into music and music production and also hanging out with friends in my spare time.
          I wanted to take this course because I want to have experience in front end so I can understand back end better. 
          I have been a member my whole life and I served in the Virginia Richmond Mission. I like J Golden Kimball that says 
          “I may not always walk the straight and narrow, but I cross it as often as I can.” One of my favorite scriptures
           would probably have to be helaman 5:12. I'm excited to be in this class!</p>
